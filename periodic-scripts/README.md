## NBHEXT Backend: periodic scripts

Here are scripts that should run with a certain period in order to keep the data fresh and always up-to-date.

#### Usage
- Run `setup-scripts.py` in order to set all necessary jobs to your crontab.
- Run `clear_cron.py` in order to delete all jobs from your cron. Please noticy that "all" means *all*, not necessarily jobs set up by `clear_cron.py`.
